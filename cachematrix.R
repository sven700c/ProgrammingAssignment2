## A pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there is a benefit to caching 
## the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix", which is a list containing functions to:
##
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
        getinv <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix 
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinv()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinv(inv)
        inv
}
